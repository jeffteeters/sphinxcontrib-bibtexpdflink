About
=====


This Sphinx extension (named "sphinx-bibtexpdflink", parsed as "bibtex pdf link") adds a link to a PDF
file and a "notes" file (source is a .rst file) to citations generated by the
`sphinxcontrib-bibtex <http://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ extension
and `sphinxcontrib-bibtex2 <https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/sphinxcontrib-bibtex/tree/develop/sphinxcontrib/bibtex2>`_
extension (which is included with the sphinxcontrib-bibtex extension).

The purpose is to allow someone viewing a citation to readily open a PDF file containing the 
publication the citation is for, and also open a file containing notes about the publication.

The extension works by adding two options to the Sphinx configuration file ``conf.py``.  These
options specify the directories containing the PDF files and the notes files.  The names of the PDF and
notes files must be the same as the bibtex citation key, but with extension “.pdf” (for the PDF file) and “.rst”
for the note file.  When generating the citation, these directories are checked for the PDF and note
file, and if found, the links to the files are added to the citation.  If the citation is being included
within a note file, then the link to the note will not be generated (since it links to the file itself),
but instead just the name of the file (and not a link) is displayed along with the text "(this file)".
