About
=====

The bibtexpdflink (parsed as "bibtex pdf link") extension works with the sphinxcontrib-bibtex
and sphinxcontrib-bibtex2 extensions.  It enhances these
extensions by augmenting generated references to include a link to the PDF of the reference (if the PDF is provided) and also
to a file containing notes about the reference (if that is provided).  To have the links generated the name of the PDF
and notes files must be the same as the identifier used to cite the reference (but with extension pdf for the pdf and
rst for the notes) and the files must be stored in directories that are specified by configuration options.
